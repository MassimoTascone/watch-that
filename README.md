**Watch-That** is a frontend application developed using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**. The app allows users to explore and discover various movies and TV shows.

I undertook the development of Watch-That to enhance my skills in front-end web development using Next.js, TypeScript, and modern CSS frameworks(Tailwind, DaisyUI). By building this real-world application, I aimed to gain practical experience in working with data retrieval, user interface design, and state management. Through this project, I sought to deepen my understanding of Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities, TypeScript's static typing, and the integration of various libraries and tools commonly used in modern web development such as Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
